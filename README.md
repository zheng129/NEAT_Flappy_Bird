# Playing Flappy Bird Using NEAT

Got the great idea from [techwithtim](https://github.com/techwithtim/NEAT-Flappy-Bird) so I decided to try it out myself.

And it worked just fine so this might be an inspiration of AI playing Super Mario Bros for me, knowing that somebody somewhere must have done it already. 

Eventually, I might be able to work my way up to AI playing DOTA2 just like OpenAI? I do not know, but I am looking forward to it.
